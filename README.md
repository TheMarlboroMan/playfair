# playfair

A puerile implementation of the playfair cypher.

# why?

Sometimes you just are bored on a seaside town.

# does this work?

I tried it for a bit and it seemed to. I cannot, however, put my hand in the fire for it.

# how can I use it?

The playfair.cpp file in the src directory contains the help text. Or just build it and execute it with no options.
